## SUMMARY
**Conflux** is an RTS that is based on the four elements of water, air, earth, and fire. All players will open with the same units and choose elements as they increase tech levels.

## PURPOSE
This project was a 30 day challenge to finish a functioning prototype for the month of February 2025. Due to life events, this extended into March as well. This is a continuation of my goal to finish 12 prototypes over the year.
